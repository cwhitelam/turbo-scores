## How to Use These Branches

1. Start with one branch at a time
2. Make focused commits addressing the specific issue
3. Create a PR when the improvement is complete
4. Merge to main before starting work on the next branch

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Switch to an improvement branch
git checkout [branch-name]

# Make your changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Description of improvement"

# Push changes and create PR
git push -u origin [branch-name]
```
